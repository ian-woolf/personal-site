I live in southern England with my wife Jenny. My passions include cricket, computing, gaming and films. I also love travelling.

I work as a software developer, working mainly with javascript-based technologies deployed through cloud providers. I have experience across the whole stack but I tend to find solving problems on the server side more engaging.

I like working with smart people to solve interesting problems, and I ask a lot of questions. I'm always looking to add new skills to my toolbox, and gain experience that helps me pick the best one for the task at hand.
